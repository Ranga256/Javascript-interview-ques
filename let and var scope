function letScope() {
  let name = "Ranga";
  function printName() {
    if (name === "Ranga") {
      let name = "KRSV";
      console.log(name);
    }
    console.log(name);
  }
  printName();
}
letScope();

Output:KRSV Ranga -> let scope is block scope where inside function(inside if) intialization overided and after 
the block ended value became to original which is outer scope.


function varScope() {
  var player = "Virat";
  function displayPlayer() {
    if (player === "Virat") {
      var player = "VK";
      console.log(player);
    }
    console.log(player);
  }
  displayPlayer();
}

varScope();

output: Undefined-> var variables are functional scope, When displayPlayer fn starts executing, Execution context of
displayPlayer will be created in callstack and at the memory creation phase var variable player is initialized as undefined. 
hence if condition will become false and It will print only undefined.
